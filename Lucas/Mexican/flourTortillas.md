# Flour Tortillas
Makes 12 8in diameter tortillas.
## Ingredients
- **3/4 lb** (2.75 C) All-purpose flour
- **5 T** Fat (lard, duck fat, beef fat, vegetable)
  - half animal half vegetable is optimal
- **3/4 t** Salt
- **3/4 C** Very warm water

## Instructions
1. Combine flour and fat. Use your fingers in a large bowl, spin in a food processor or use a paddle attachment for a mixer until completely incorporated.
2. Disolve the salt in the warm water and then add 1/2 of it to the mixture. Incorporate. Add other half. Incorporate.
3. Now knead the dough until smooth. Hydration levels here are very important. If it is clumpy and not becoming smooth add water. If it is sticky and slimey add flour. We want the dough to ultimately be medium-stiff--definitely not firm but not soft like a bread dough.
4. Divide into 12 balls, or however many you please, and let rest for 30 mins. Be sure they are covered with plastic wrap or a damp towel so they do not form a crust.
5. Use a tortilla press and/or a rolling pin to make circles just barely thin enough so you are able to see your hand through the dough. Be sure to use excess flour to prevent sticking to surfaces.
6. Cook in a pan, preferably a thicc one, on medium heat. Flip it halfway through at approximately 45-60 seconds. It really depends on temperature and the pan, so be observant and make adjustments. Be sure you are cooking the inside of the tortilla. You are looking for those classic brown splotches on either side. If there is any burning you need to reduce heat.
7. When a tortilla is done cooking wrap it with the others in a damp towel.
8. If storing for later seal them inside of something. (plastic wrap, bags, tupperware)

To heat up later there are two options:
1. (Bulk) Wrap 6-8 tortillas in tin foil and throw in the oven at 325 degrees for 15 to 20 mins. 
2. (Luxury) In medium hot pan put a pad of butter and spread evenly. Individually fry tortillas for around 10 seconds a side. Be sure it is plyable and hot before removing.
