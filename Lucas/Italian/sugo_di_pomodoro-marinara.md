# Sugo di Pomodoro
a.k.a. Marinara. Make alot and can it. Or not you lazy bastard.

## Ingrediants:
- **28 oz** Canned whole San Marzano Tomatoes (ideally Certified D.O.P)
- **1/4 C** Extra virgin olive oil
- **7 ea** Garlic cloves, sliced thin
- **Lrg sprig** Basil
- **TT** Hot stuff - fresno peppers, chili flake, etc.
- **TT** Salt
- **TT** Balsamic vinegar reduction (Optional)
  
## Instructions:
1. IN a pot brown the garlic in oil. Just until it is golden. Do not let parts of the garlic become **dark** brown or black.
2. Add tomatoes. 
3. Add hot stuff. I prefer fresnos, which I just smash once or slice in half. You just need to allow liquid to penetrate the skin since you will not cook for a long time.
4. Add your sprig of basil to the top and allow it to wilt in to the sauce.
5. Stew at a medium to medium-low heat until the oil is orange in color.
6. Remove larges stems. Blend until you reach desired chunkiness. I like smooth with a few chunks.
7. (optional) Return to pot. As far as seasoning goes you are just building a base. No need to season to final levels, this is done in pan before serving. Balsamic vinegar reduction is **NOT** traditional but I like to add a little. Maybe 3 dashes. It brings depth and a sweetness that begins to round out the flavor profile of the sauce.
8. (optional) CAN SOME! Flavors develop over time so even if you do not can, flavor peaks a few days after cooking.
