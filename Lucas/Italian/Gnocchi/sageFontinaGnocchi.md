# Sage and Fontina Gnocchi
Delicate, deep, and unique. Recipe is for two entree sized servings.
- makes 2 entree sized servings


## Ingredients
- **2 Handfulls** Gnocchi
- **Handful** Picked Sage
- **2 T** Butter
- **Handfull** Fontina (small chunks)
- **To Cover** Parmesan
- **TT** Lemon
- **TT** Salt
- **TT** Pepper

## Instructions
1. Bring salted water to a boil and turn oven on as hot as it goes and/or turn on the broiler.
2. Choosing your pan: it is very important you do not overcrowd the pan here. We want to have the pan at around 70% bottom cover with gnocchi. Less is definitely better than more. A thick pan is best and will give you a better bottom sear. So use a cast iron if you have one.
3. Add butter to the pan.
4. While the butter is browning, not burning (please not burning), add the gnocchi to the boiling water. 
5. When gnocchi begin to float, remove the floaters with a slotted spoon and add them to the pan.
6. As soon as all of the gnocchi are out of the water toss the gnocchi a bit to coat them in butter. 
7. Evenly spread the fontina across the pan, microplane parmesan to cover the gnocchi, the more the merrier. 
8. Put the pan in the oven under the broiler. We want to crisp up the top. We dont want to dry out the gnocchi. There can be a lot of variance in this cook time but I would say 1-4 minutes.
9. Remove from oven crack a lot of black pepper on top.
10. (Optional) I like zest of lemon and/or a squeeze of lemon to brighten things up. 

### Notes: 
1. Sage should be light and crispy. Not a nuisance to eat. If it is stringy or leafy it is underfried. If it is burnt, well, it is burnt.
2. If gnocchi is falling apart they are either overcooked or underworked. My issue was always the latter.
