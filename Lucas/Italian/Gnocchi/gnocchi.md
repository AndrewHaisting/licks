# Gnocchi
Soft and pillowy. Perfect vessel for cheese and sauce.
- makes around 8 entree sized servings


## Ingredients
- **1 kilo** Baked Potatoes (fork tender and cooled)
- **150 g** Flour (double zero preferable)
- **2 ea** Yolk
- **TT** Salt
- **TT** Pepper
- **AN** Rice Flour

## Instructions:
1. Rice the potatoes and cool them uncovered overnight. This will dry out the potatoes a little bit. The enemy of soft gnocchi is too much moisture.
2. Mix all ingredients (besides rice flour) together and knead until combined. A little bit of inhomogeneity is just fine.
3. If you feel it is too sticky at this point use rice flour on surface of the dough instead of flour. It doesn't gum up like wheat flour does.
4. Now cut off pieces of the dough and roll them into logs with diameter between a nickel and a quarter. Smaller chunks will be easier to roll out.
5. Portion the gnocchis from the logs with a knife or board scraper. I usually do around an 3/4 - 1 inch.
6. You can use these as gnocchi just fine, or you can look up how to shape gnocchi on youtube (ex. fork method). This is too difficult to explain in text. However, for whichever method you choose I recommend rolling a portion into a ball and attempting the shaping technique. If it falls apart or is cracking, roll it between your hands for 10 seconds and try again. More developed gluten will help keep it together. Repeat. Once you have a nice gnocchi you know how much to roll the following gnocchis. Rolling the gnocchis first gives a nicer shape to the final product.

### Notes:
1. The more you work the gnocchi dough the denser and gummier it gets. If it is underworked it may be too light and fall apart during forming or cooking. 
2. You can freeze or refridgerate these, just use rice flour instead of wheat flour to prevent gumming.
