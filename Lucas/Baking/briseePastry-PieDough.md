# Pâté Brisée a.k.a. Pie Dough
Perfect pie crust everytime. Don't be afraid of the accents on the e's. Makes a 12 in pie crust.

## Ingredients:

- **1 1/4 C or 160 g** all-purpose flour
- **8 T or 112g** unsalted butter (cubed and frozen)
  - can use salted butter just ommit salt from recipe
- **1/2 t** Salt
- **1/2 - 1 1/2 t** Sugar
- **3 - 4 T** Ice water

## Instructions:

### Dough:
1. Combine flour, salt and sugar in a food processor or mixer. I recommend the food processor but if doing larger batches use a mixer.
2. Add the butter half at a time. Pulse or mix until it resembles a coarse meal. Some butter pieces should be the size of peas.
   - You want frozen butter because it causes the butter to be cut into small units and not spread or smear. Small pieces of butter create pockets of steam that result in **flakey** crust.
   - If you dice your butter small the processor/mixer does less work and minimizes mechanical heat.
3. Add half the water and pulse 8 times. Add the other half and pulse 8 more times.
4. If at this point the dough barely begins to clump together and you can pinch the crumbly dough and it holds together it is ready. Otherwise add a little more cold water and pulse again until the desired consistency is reached.
5. Are you ready to become a classic french chef? Well make sure you aren't wearing deodorant because it is fraisage time. Dump the dough onto the table and press your palm into a bulk of it and smoosh forward. Think about packing it together and then spreading it across the table a few inches. Do it twice and reform your pile. Repeat three or four times for a total of 8 to 10 smooshes.
6. Form a ball and refrigerate for an hour. I usually leave it overnight.
7. Now roll out to about an 1/8 of an inch using extra flour to reduce sticking.
8. Line your pan. Use a piece of extra dough to press the dough into the corner of the pan. This saves you from cutting holes in the dough with your fingers.
9. Clean up the ridges as you wish and blind bake the crust before filling.

## Baking:
- Line the dough with aluminum foil and fill it with dried beans, rice or baking weights.
- Freeze for 30 mins to an hour.
- Bake at 350 °F for 45 mins.
- Remove beans by grabbing the foil and lifting them out.
